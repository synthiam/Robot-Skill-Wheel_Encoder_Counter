# Robot Skill: Wheel Encoder Counter

The Wheel Encoder Counter skill for Synthiam ARC enhances your robot's navigation capabilities by interfacing with supported wheel encoder firmware. This skill allows ARC to communicate with the wheel encoders connected to your Arduino UNO (or compatible board), enabling precise tracking of wheel rotations for accurate distance and movement calculations.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Wheel Encoder Counts:** Retrieve live encoder values from the left and right wheels to monitor robot movement with precision.
- **Directional Adjustment:** Ensure correct encoder counting for both forward and backward movement by dynamically setting wheel directions.
- **Seamless EZB Integration:** Extends the EZB protocol to support advanced encoder-based navigation features, making it an essential tool for robotics projects requiring precise control and feedback.

### Getting Started
The compiled installer for this skill is available for download here: [Wheel Encoder Counter Robot Skill](https://synthiam.com/Support/Skills/Navigation/Wheel-Encoder-Counter?id=17591).

Once installed, this skill pairs perfectly with the [Wheel Encoder Firmware](https://synthiam.com/Firmware/Wheel-Encoder-Firmware-NVXCXGPCQMJ) designed for Arduino UNO. The firmware communicates seamlessly with ARC to process encoder data and provide commands for encoder reset, retrieval, and directional updates.

### Ideal Use Cases
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Measure and control distances traveled with precision for autonomous robots.
- **Position Tracking:** Integrate with ARC's navigation and mapping capabilities for better route planning and obstacle avoidance.
- **Custom Robotics Projects:** Ideal for any robotics application requiring reliable movement feedback.
